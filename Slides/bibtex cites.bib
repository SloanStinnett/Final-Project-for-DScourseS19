A host of difficulties are associated with the concept of personal responsibility in the field of medicine. These include, in particular, theoretical considerations of justice and such practical issues as multiple causal factors in medicine and freedom of health behaviour. In the article, personal responsibility is evaluated from the perspective of several theories of justice. It is argued that in a healthcare system based on both equality of opportunity and solidarity, responsible health behaviour can—in principle—be justifiably expected. While the practical problems associated with personal responsibility are important, they do not warrant the common knee-jerk refusal to think more deeply about responsibility for health as a means of allocating healthcare resources. In conclusion, the possibility of introducing personal responsibility as a fair rationing criterion is briefly sketched.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we explore the consumer experience of responsibilization, wherein consumers are tasked with addressing social issues via their consumption choices. We study an approach to responsibilization which we label conscious pricing. Conscious pricing asks consumers to place a price on morality: How much would they pay for their lunch to combat the social issue of food insecurity? Conscious pricing stems from the broader movement of conscious capitalism, defined by its chief architects as an approach to business wherein the goal is to create value for all stakeholders: financial, ecological, ethical, and spiritual. Strategies such as conscious capitalism rely on consumers acting responsibly, assuming that consumers, when presented with the opportunity to “do good,” will do so, and that consumers will prefer companies who provide them this opportunity. Using a case study approach and online reviews, in our analysis of Panera Cares, we find that consumers in fact experience discomfort when asked to address social issues via how much they choose to pay for their meal. Because food insecurity is embodied by homeless people eating with them in the café, eating in the café is perceived as unpleasant, and the homeless also feel demoralized. This discomposure leads consumers to resist the subject position of being responsibilized by not supporting the organization that is tasking them to do so. This study is the first empirical examination of the consumer experience of consumer responsibilization and allows us to contribute to a deepened understanding of consumer ethics.},

	abstract = {The state’s Active Transportation Program—administered by the California Transportation Commission ({CTC}), in coordination with the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans)—provides funding to infrastructure and non-infrastructure projects that facilitate travelers being physically active through biking and walking. Some of the primary goals of the program include increasing the number of walking and biking trips, increasing safety and mobility, and enhancing public health. In approving the 2018-19 budget package, the Legislature directed our office to review certain aspects of the program, such as the types of projects funded from the program and the extent to which funded projects are located in and directly benefit disadvantaged communities. This report responds to that requirement. Based on our review of the program and data currently available on project outcomes, we find that most program funding supports infrastructure projects, such as constructing sidewalks, bike lanes, and crossing signals. The projects funded are similar across various components of the program and most projects benefit disadvantaged communities. We also find that it is impossible to determine key program outcomes, such as whether the program is resulting in increased walking and biking and improved safety. This is because accurate information is not reported on these outcomes. In view of our findings, we recommend that the Legislature require the {CTC} and Caltrans to collect more accurate project outcome data. We also recommend that the Legislature consider focusing the statewide component of the program on larger and more transformative projects and consider providing additional flexibility to Metropolitan Planning Organizations ({MPOs}) for their regional component of the program.},

This article explains luck egalitarianism’s main ideas, and the debates that have accompanied its rise to prominence. There are two main parts to the discussion. The first part sets out three key moves in the influential early statements of Dworkin, Arneson, and Cohen: the brute luck/option luck distinction, the specification of brute luck in everyday or theoretical terms, and the specification of advantage as resources, welfare, or some combination of these. The second part covers three later developments: the democratic egalitarian critique of luck egalitarianism, the luck egalitarian acceptance of pluralism, and luck egalitarian doubts about the significance of the brute luck/option luck distinction.},

	abstract = {Marijuana liberalization policies are gaining momentum in the {USA}, coupled with limited federal interference and growing dispensary industry. This evolving regulatory landscape underscores the importance of understanding the attitudinal/perceptual pathways from marijuana policy to marijuana use behavior, especially for adolescents and young adults. Our study uses the restricted-access National Survey on Drug Use and Health ({NSDUH}) 2004–2012 data and a difference-in-differences design to compare the pre-policy, post-policy changes in marijuana-related attitude/perception between adolescents and young adults from ten states that implemented medical marijuana laws during the study period and those from the remaining states. We examined four attitudinal/perception pathways that may play a role in adolescent and young adult marijuana use behavior, including (1) perceived availability of marijuana, (2) perceived acceptance of marijuana use, (3) perceived wrongfulness of recreational marijuana use, and (4) perceived harmfulness of marijuana use. We found that state implementation of medical marijuana laws between 2004 and 2012 was associated with a 4.72\% point increase (95\% {CI} 0.15, 9.28) in the probability that young adults perceived no/low health risk related to marijuana use. Medical marijuana law implementation is also associated with a 0.37\% point decrease (95\% {CI} − 0.72, − 0.03) in the probability that adolescents perceived parental acceptance of marijuana use. As more states permit medical marijuana use, marijuana-related attitude/perception need to be closely monitored, especially perceived harmfulness. The physical and psychological effects of marijuana use should be carefully investigated and clearly conveyed to the public.},

We present several experiments applying machine learning techniques to predict with high accuracy the ruling of the French Supreme Court and the law area to which a case belongs to. We also investigate the influence of the time period in which a ruling was made on the form of the case description and the extent to which we need to mask information in a full case ruling to automatically obtain training and test data that resembles case descriptions. We developed a mean probability ensemble system combining the output of multiple {SVM} classifiers. We report results of 98\% average F1 score in predicting a case ruling, 96\% F1 score for predicting the law area of a case, and 87.07\% F1 score on estimating the date of a ruling.},

With the increasing number of legal cases, professionals typically endure heavy workloads on a daily basis. Although a few previous studies have applied information technology to legal cases, according to our research, no prior studies have predicted a pending judgement using legal documents. In this article, we introduce an innovative solution to predict relevant rulings. The proposed approach employs text mining methods to extract features from precedents and applies a text classifier to automatically classify judgements according to sentiment analysis. This approach can assist legal experts or litigants in predicting possible judgements. Experimental results from a judgement data set reveal that our approach is a satisfactory method for judgement classification.},
