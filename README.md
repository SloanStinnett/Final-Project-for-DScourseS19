In order to reproduce the results all one needs to do is place the files from the data folder in the R code folder somewhere on their computer
then simply change the second line of the r code so that it reads path<-"[path to where you stored the data]".
after this you should only have to run the code inorder to reproduce the results discussed in the paper.
