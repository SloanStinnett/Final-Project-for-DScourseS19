# How to reproduce the results 
In order to reproduce the results all one needs to do is place the files found in the data folder in the R code folder into their directory
then simply change the second line of the r code so that it reads path<-"[path to where you stored the data]".
after this you should only have to run the code inorder to reproduce the results discussed in the paper. 
# For specific results look to the R code:

The pie chart of win ratios can be found at lines 132 through 152.

The bar chart of average sentiment proportions and the calculation of average length can be foun at lines 212 through 239.

The results of the classification models, including the confusion matrixs, can be found on lines 324 through 359.
